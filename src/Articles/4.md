JavaScript - React - General

# Best Practice

## Components

### Naming

* A react component will start with an uppercase.

* When a component is going to return a plain function we will set the first latter to lowercase "component", not "Component". 

***

## Prop Types 

[dox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)

[Old way dox](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)

Setting prop types is a best practice for debugging your code (like TDD with TypeScript). It lets you set which type your component needs to receive and will put an ERROR if the set prop isn't wright. 

***

## Props vs Children

###Props

Props is passed down between components truhg declaration in the tab of the component.

```react
<Card name={"Alon"} changeName={changeNameFunc}/>
```

In this example "name" and "changeName" are props that are passed into Card component.

The props are declared as an argument in the Card component, and accessed trough that.

```react
const Card =({name, changeName}) =>{
     return(
<>
<h1>{name}<h1/>
<button onClick={changeName}/>
</>
)

}
```

### Children

Children are all data that is passed inside two tags of the same component.

```react
<CardDeck>
    <h1>"I'm your child!"<h1/>
<CardDeck/>
```

The children are accessed by calling `props.children`.

```react
const CardDeck =() =>{
     return(
        <div>
            props.children
       <div/>
     )

}
```

## Hooks

[DOX](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

### UseState

How to control state in react.

Every time the state will change react will do a re render.

First import the useState from react.

UseState is an array with two functions, the first will declare the variable and the second to set it. It must be declared inside a function.

```react
const [stateVar, setStateVar] = useState(initialState)
```

To update the state we call the set method we created (setStateVar in our example).

```react
setStateVar(stateVar + 1)
```

The set state function will trigger at the and of the parsing which can cause problems. To ensure the state changes call an arrow function.

```react
setStateVar((prevState) => prevState + 1))
```

## useRef

[dox](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref)

UseRef (use reference) is a way to keep a variable between renders without triggering a rerender.

#### How to use:

First import the "useRef" hook from "React".

Declare you var by seating it to the "useRef" hook with the initial value in the parenthesis (useRef(initialValue)).

UseRef returns an object, it will set the initial value to the current key.

To exces that value call `yourVar.current`.



#### Common use:

##### Referencing a Tag:

You can point an HTML element by setting it to a ref, instead of doing a query selector.

Set the ref argument of an HTML element to the useRef var.

Now you can think of the ref variable like the HTML element, and add focus to it or hide it.

 

**Example:**

```react
import React, {useRef} from "react"

const RefComp = () => {
	const divContent = useRef("Hey!");
	const divRef = useRef("Hey!");
    
    const refFocus = () => {
        divRef.current.focus()
    }
    
    return (
		<div ref={divRef.current}>{divContent.current}</div>
        <button onClick={()=>refFucous()}>Focus on Div</button>
    )
}
```

## useEffect

[DOX](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)

Is a hook that can be used to run at the start of a render at the end or any time something changes.

```react
useEffect(()=>{
	console.log("I just woke up")
	return console.log("I'm going to sleep..")
},[VAR_TO_WATCH])
```

 UseEffect takes a function. That function will run on render and any time the secound parameter of useEffect (VAR_TO_WATCH in the example) will change.

The return of the function is a cleanup function that will run before a re render.

***

## useReducer

[DOX](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)

Helps use handle object changes in react.

It is a good practice to write the reducer of useReducer outside the react component.

```react
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(colorReducer, {red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0});
```

in this example state will equal `{red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0}` .

**Dispatch:**

When dispatch is called (colorDispatch in this example) it will call the reducer (colorReducer in our example) with the arguments in the reducer.

In this example when we call `colorDispatch({ type: "change_red", payload: COLOR_INCROMETION }`, it's actually calling `colorDispatch(colorReducer(state, state{ type: "change_red", payload: COLOR_INCROMETION }))`.

You can add as many parameters as you like.

**Reducer:**

The reducer will get the state automatically when called with the reducer.

The second argument is (in good practice) the action.

The reducer will always return the state or you are risking an undefined state.

**Action:**

By best practices looks like so:

```react
{type: string, payload: data}
```

Type: will describe what the reducer needs to do.

payload: will be the data it will do it with.

```react
import React, { useReducer } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, View } from "react-native";
import ColorCounter from "../components/ColorCounter";

const colorReducer = (state, action) => {
  // state === {red: number, green: number, blue: number}
  // action === {type: 'change_red'||'change_green'||'chang_blue', payload: numberâ†’COLOR_INCROMETION}
  const { red, green, blue } = state;
  const { type, payload } = action;

  switch (type) {
    case "change_red":
      return 255 < red + payload || red + payload < 0
        ? state
        : { ...state, red: red + payload };
    case "change_green":
      return 255 < green + payload || green + payload < 0
        ? state
        : { ...state, green: green + payload };
    case "change_blue":
      return 255 < blue + payload || blue + payload < 0
        ? state
        : { ...state, blue: blue + payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const COLOR_INCROMETION = 15;

const SquareScreenWReducer = () => {
  const [state, colorDispatch] = useReducer(colorReducer, {red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0,});
  const { red, green, blue } = state;

  return (
    <View>
      <ColorCounter
        color={"red"}
        onColorIncrease={() =>
          colorDispatch({ type: "change_red", payload: COLOR_INCROMETION })
        }
        onColorDecrease={() =>
          colorDispatch({ type: "change_red", payload: -1 * COLOR_INCROMETION })
        }
      />
      <ColorCounter
        color={"green"}
        onColorIncrease={() =>
          colorDispatch({ type: "change_green", payload: COLOR_INCROMETION })
        }
        onColorDecrease={() =>
          colorDispatch({ type: "change_green", payload: -1 * COLOR_INCROMETION })
        }
      />
      <ColorCounter
        color={"blue"}
        onColorIncrease={() =>
          colorDispatch({ type: "change_blue", payload: COLOR_INCROMETION })
        }
        onColorDecrease={() =>
          colorDispatch({ type: "change_blue", payload: -1 * COLOR_INCROMETION })
        }
      />
      <View
        style={{
          height: 150,
          width: 150,
          backgroundColor: `rgb(${red},${blue},${green})`,
        }}
      ></View>
    </View>
  );

};

export default SquareScreenWReducer;

```

***

## Custom Hooks

Use case: When we want to reuse a piece of logic that needs hooks in multiple places.

The best practice is to add a 'hooks' folder under the src folder that will hold all the hooks files.

Its best practice to start the name of your hook with the "use" preflex.

A hook will return an array of values or/and functions, or nothing

```react
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import yelp from "../API/yelp";

export default useRestaurants = (searchVal) => {
  const [errorMsg, setErrorMsg] = useState("");
  const [restaurants, setRestaurants] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (searchVal === "" && restaurants.length === 0 && errorMsg === "") {
      fetchResYelp("pasta");
    }
    return () => {
      setErrorMsg("");
    };
  }, []);

  const fetchResYelp = async (PrTerm) => {
    try {
      const yelpObj = await yelp.get("/search", {
        params: {
          term: PrTerm,
          limit: "50",
          location: "san jose",
        },
      });
      setRestaurants(yelpObj.data.businesses);
    } catch {
      setErrorMsg("Ops... the search failed, please try again later.");
    }
  };

  return [fetchResYelp, errorMsg, restaurants];
};
```



Extracted

```react
const [searchVal, setSearchVal] = useState("");
const [fetchResYelp, errorMsg, restaurants] = useRestaurants(searchVal);
```

# Context

Allows us to pass state dawn without propdriling.

Any time the state object of the context changes all the context tree will update, from the provider to the origin of the change will update.
