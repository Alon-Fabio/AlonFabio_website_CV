# axios

## What it does?

Axios tries to make API call easier and better by (1) braking them dawn to segments using functions and (2) making it easier o reuse code.

## Getting started?

1. Install the package [dox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).
2. Create a repository for your axios files (recommended).
3. Create a file with the base URL of the API you are going to use.

#### Working with axios

Import axios and create an instance of axios using the create function and define the baseURL.

```js
import axios from "axios";

export default axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://my.API.com",
});
```
